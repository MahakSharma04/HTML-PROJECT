    <h2>Kasol</h2>
    <p>So it was June, when my cousin told me that he will be going to the USA in January 2023 to pursue
         masters. We thought let us have one memorable trip together and this is how the Kasol trip was
          planned! We had our flight from Mumbai to Chandigarh and then traveled till Kasol by road.  It took 
          approximately 9-10 hours but the views we got to see throughout were exhilarating!
        We reached Kasol around 6:00 am and we had our stay booked at Alpine Guest House which is located on 
        the banks of the river Parvati. After resting for a while, we went to have breakfast in their in-house
         cafe Off Limits that serves hemp infused coffee & food with mountain views. There is a nice deck from
          which you can watch the sun rays brighten the mountains while listening to the Parvati river gushing 
          by! We then explored the local cafes and food joints where we had one the most authentic momos, pizza
           and brownies!

    In the evening we went shopping and  although the market street is a little small, we found shops lined
     with night vision glasses, neon trinkets and accessories, woolen clothes, caps and shoes, all of which 
     one would want to take back home. The weather was pleasant throughout the day but in the evening it grew 
     colder.
