        <h2>Taj-Mahal</h2>
            <p>Taj Mal is a vestige of a most beautiful and sacred love story that 
                proves the so-called “Eternal Love”.An outstanding architectural, monumental work by
                the Yamuna.Famous poet Rabindranath Tagore portrayed it as ‘a teardrop on the cheek of
                 the universe’ and Rudyard Kipling called it ‘the embodiment of all things pure’. Mughal 
                 emperor Shah Jahan famously said – “it made the moon and the sun drop tears on it”. What is 
                 it that we are talking about? Of course the one and only Taj Mahal, a monument built out of 
                 immense love and memory,a monument that made hundreds of thousands of people bow down to their
                  knees, a monument that made the city of Agra a famous and widely visited tourist spot in India. 
                  It is a place where you’ll fall in love with the Mughal Era and pleasure yourself with the 
                  architecture and royalty. And have you seen Taj Mahal at night? If not, then let us tell you 
                  it is one of the most magnificent sights ever!

            <p> The lockdown is getting on our nerves now… But hey, let’s not forget… It’s not for the government’s, but 
                our own safety. The more strictly we follow the rules laid down by the authorities, the earlier we’ll be 
                able to beat the pandemic. However, in times when we can’t travel far and wide, physically, at least for 
                some more days, we can certainly do so virtually or go back in time cherishing the beautiful memories we 
                have made on our holidays earlier. At the end of the day, when it’s an intangible thing like travel, is it 
                supposed to do anything different?! It’s memories we bring back from our holidays, only to be cherished for
                a lifetime, from wherever and in whatever circumstances we are at any given point in time. In this series
                of blogs, we bring to you some amazing stories of travellers who were left speechless when they travelled 
                to their dream destinations, but have indeed turned out to be storytellers while narrating and sharing
                their experiences.

                    <h2>Mahakaleshwar</h2>
                    <p>When did the Mahakala temple first come in existence, is difficult to tell. 
                        However, the event may be assigned to the Pre-historic period. Puranas narrate that 
                        it was first established by Prajapita Brahma. There is reference to the appointment of
                         prince Kumarasena by king Chanda Pradyota in 6th c. BC for looking after the law and 
                         order situations of Mahakala temple. The punch-marked coins of Ujjain, belonging to
                          4th-3rd c. BC, bear the figure of Lord Siva on them.
