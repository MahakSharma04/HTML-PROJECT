        <p> The famous Taj Mahal story always tends to intrigue listeners! The Taj was built by Emperor Shah Jahan in the loving memory of his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who is said to have passed away after giving birth to their 14th child in 1631. Call it a symbol of immense love, the emperor was left so heartbroken that his hair turned grey eventually in grief. That’s when he decided to build a memorial in her memory and the construction began the following year, 1632.

          It is said that the main building took eight years to finish. The whole monument wasn’t completed until 1653. The sad part is, Shah Jahan was overthrown by his own son Aurangzeb soon after the building was finished. He was imprisoned inside the Agra Fort for the rest of his life where he used to look at his remarkable creation through the window, admiring it and remembering his beloved Mumtaz. He died in 1666 and was buried alongside his wife Mumtaz inside the tomb of Taj Mahal.
          
          It is said that over 20,000 people from India and Central Asia were recruited to work on the architecture. Shah Jahan was keen to bring some specialists from Europe to produce the delicate white marbles and pietra dura (marble inlay work), which was made up of thousands of semiprecious stones. In the year 1983, the Taj was given a highly reputed designation and it was recognized as a World Heritage Site. It underwent a big restoration project in the early 20th century. It is not just the beauty of this glittering white marble structure but also the Taj Mahal history that attract people from around the world to Agra.
