    I loved the fact that I could make it to my dream destinations. Haha. Actually, it’s true. Many times 
    your journey itself becomes your destination, and something similar happened with me on my trip to
     Kedarnath and Badrinath. My trip wasn’t a smooth highway but I enjoyed its crookedness just as I enjoyed 
     the crooked roads up to the mountains on my journey. With train schedules going haywire, it led some 
     strangers into my travel experience and they only added to the bliss. It was my solo trip, and I must say,
      as we wander about, looking for ways out of certain challenging situations we might find ourselves into,
       we get to meet so many new people, most of who are so friendly, helpful, and indeed come across as 
       angels.
