    <h2>Kedarnath</h2>
    <p>The lockdown is getting on our nerves now… But hey, let’s not forget… It’s not for the government’s, but 
        our own safety. The more strictly we follow the rules laid down by the authorities, the earlier we’ll be 
        able to beat the pandemic. However, in times when we can’t travel far and wide, physically, at least for 
        some more days, we can certainly do so virtually or go back in time cherishing the beautiful memories we 
        have made on our holidays earlier. At the end of the day, when it’s an intangible thing like travel, is it 
        supposed to do anything different?! It’s memories we bring back from our holidays, only to be cherished for
        a lifetime, from wherever and in whatever circumstances we are at any given point in time. In this series
        of blogs, we bring to you some amazing stories of travellers who were left speechless when they travelled 
        to their dream destinations, but have indeed turned out to be storytellers while narrating and sharing
        their experiences.

    I loved the fact that I could make it to my dream destinations. Haha. Actually, it’s true. Many times 
    your journey itself becomes your destination, and something similar happened with me on my trip to
     Kedarnath and Badrinath. My trip wasn’t a smooth highway but I enjoyed its crookedness just as I enjoyed 
     the crooked roads up to the mountains on my journey. With train schedules going haywire, it led some 
     strangers into my travel experience and they only added to the bliss. It was my solo trip, and I must say,
      as we wander about, looking for ways out of certain challenging situations we might find ourselves into,
       we get to meet so many new people, most of who are so friendly, helpful, and indeed come across as 
       angels.
